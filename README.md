# FT-DOS
⭐ FT-DOS Version 1.01 — Fake Terminal Operating System Simulator

A fully interactive, hyper-realistic, completely safe simulation of a retro command-line operating system — designed entirely in a single Windows Batch file.

FT-DOS (Fake-Terminal-DOS) is a fictional operating system environment inspired by classic MS-DOS, early Windows bootloaders, and retro BIOS utilities.
Despite its realism, FT-DOS is 100% fake and sandboxed, performing no real system modifications. Every command, animation, BSOD, error screen, bootloader, and diagnostic tool is fully simulated for fun and educational purposes.

🎯 What is FT-DOS?

FT-DOS is a text-based "operating system" that runs inside Windows CMD.
It recreates the feel of old-school computers with:

Boot animations

BIOS menus

Memory scans

System diagnostics

ASCII splash screens

Fake file operations

Fake BSODs

Retro-inspired commands

Easter egg commands

A multi-OS boot selector

And even full-screen launch of “mock OSes” in your browser

All of this is done safely, using nothing but batch scripting.

🚀 Key Features
🖥️ Realistic Boot Experience

Fake BIOS (AMI-style)

POST checks

Fake RAM tests

UEFI initialization

Real-time clock display

Key-press detection to enter setup

🧩 Setup Wizard Simulation

Multi-step FT-DOS installer

Fake hardware detection

Fake file copying

Virtual package installer

Restart simulation

All animations are timing-based for realism.

🛠️ Command System

FT-DOS includes a full simulated command shell with 30+ safe commands:

setup — Runs the FT-DOS installer

dir — Shows fake file structure

help — Paginated help system (help -1, help -2, etc.)

finalize — Exits setup environment

win / boot — Opens fake Windows environments

bios — Reopens BIOS simulator

scan — Fake malware scanner

bench — Fake CPU benchmark

taskkill -system32 — Triggers a simulated BSOD (easter egg)

skeletons — Opens the spooky skeletons YouTube link

rickroll — Self-explanatory

reboot, shutdown, restart, and more

Every command is simulated. No real system directories are ever touched.

💀 Fake BSOD Engine

The simulator includes a completely safe “Blue Screen of Death” generator with:

Multiple BSOD variants

Static and scrolling versions

Auto-recovery

Color reset after crash

Debug info simulation

Again — purely visual, no real system errors occur.

🔧 Customization

FT-DOS supports:

Animation speed settings

“ASCII density” levels

Theme adjustments

Boot logo customization

Secret developer menu

You can tweak almost everything.

🌐 Integrated Fake OSes

When booting, FT-DOS lets you choose between:

Windows 12 (default)

Launches: https://lttthedev.github.io/desktop.html

Windows 93 (retro mode)

Launches: https://www.windows93.net/

Windows 96 (lite retro)

Launches: https://windows96.net/

These run in your default browser, simulating entering a graphical OS.

🧙 Easter Eggs

Hidden memory test

Secret web launcher

Rickroll command

Spooky skeletons command

Undocumented commands

Fake “Kernel Panic” mode

Boot animation alternates

Strange “corrupted” screens

Rare color-glitch event

Discover them all…

🔒 Safety

FT-DOS:

Does not modify any system files

Does not access or delete any real directories

Does not write to registry

Does not run administrator-level functions

Does not contain harmful code

Is purely cosmetic and local

Is safe to run on any Windows machine

Everything is simulated with text.

📦 Installation

Download FT-DOS_v1.01.bat

Run it normally (double-click)

Enjoy your fake operating system

Optional: convert to .exe using a BAT-to-EXE packer

No dependencies, no installs, no admin needed.
