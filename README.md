## 🎬 Overview  
**FT-DOS (Fake-Terminal DOS)** is a fully simulated, retro-inspired operating system environment implemented entirely in a Windows Batch (.bat) file. Crafted for fun, imagination and creative experimentation — FT-DOS gives you the feel of a command-driven OS, complete with BIOS splash screens, boot loaders, BSODs, system diagnostics, and hidden easter-eggs — **without ever modifying your real system**.
